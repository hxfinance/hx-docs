# Proposed Industry Standard: Privacy Commitment Format v1.0.0

## A Unified Approach to Privacy in DeFi

### Abstract

We propose a standardized format for privacy commitments in decentralized finance that would enable interoperability between privacy protocols while maintaining security and user privacy. This standard is currently being pioneered by Innocence Protocol and HX Finance as early adopters, demonstrating its practical viability.

## Background

The current DeFi privacy landscape is fragmented, with each protocol implementing its own commitment format:
- Tornado Cash uses fixed-denomination single-asset commitments
- Aztec implements account-based privacy with custom note formats
- Railgun employs UTXO-based commitments
- Each new protocol creates yet another incompatible format

This fragmentation limits user choice, reduces liquidity efficiency, and increases development overhead across the ecosystem.

## Proposed Standard

We suggest the industry adopt a unified privacy commitment format that includes:

### Core Elements
```typescript
interface PrivacyCommitmentStandard {
  // Standard identification
  standard: {
    version: string;      // Semantic versioning
    format: string;       // "privacy-commitment-standard"
  };
  
  // Cryptographic core
  commitment: string;     // Public commitment
  secret: string;         // Private preimage (encrypted)
  nullifier: string;      // Spend authorization
  
  // Flexibility for different implementations
  crypto: {
    curve: string;        // "bn254", "bls12-381", etc.
    hashFunction: string; // "poseidon", "pedersen", etc.
    proofSystem: string;  // "groth16", "plonk", "sp1", etc.
  };
  
  // Network and protocol context
  network: {
    chainId: number;
    protocol: string;
    contractAddress?: string;
  };
  
  // Multi-asset support
  balances: Record<string, string>;
  
  // Privacy metrics
  privacy: {
    anonymitySetSize?: number;
  };
  
  // Metadata and status
  status?: 'active' | 'spent' | 'pending';
  timestamp: number;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Extensibility**: Protocol-specific fields can be added without breaking compatibility
2. **Multi-asset Native**: Support for multiple tokens in a single commitment
3. **Cryptographic Agnosticism**: Works with various curves and proof systems
4. **Privacy Preserving**: Sensitive data is encrypted; public exports exclude secrets

## Benefits to the Ecosystem

### For Users
- Move between protocols without losing privacy
- Use unified tools for commitment management
- Benefit from larger combined anonymity sets
- Simplified user experience across protocols

### For Developers
- Focus on unique features rather than reinventing basics
- Leverage existing tooling and libraries
- Enable cross-protocol composability
- Reduce security audit scope

### For the Industry
- Network effects from shared standards
- Accelerated innovation through interoperability
- Improved overall privacy through larger anonymity sets
- Reduced fragmentation in the privacy ecosystem

## Current Implementation

Innocence Protocol and HX Finance are pioneering this standard in production, demonstrating:
- Practical viability of the format
- Real-world performance characteristics
- User acceptance and adoption
- Technical implementation patterns

Their implementations serve as reference examples for other protocols considering adoption.

## Adoption Path

We propose a phased approach for ecosystem adoption:

### Phase 1: Awareness (Current)
- Publication of standard specification
- Reference implementations by early adopters
- Community feedback and iteration

### Phase 2: Integration
- Protocols add import/export support
- Development of conversion tools
- Shared libraries and SDKs

### Phase 3: Native Support
- New protocols adopt natively
- Existing protocols migrate
- Cross-protocol features emerge

## Technical Considerations

### Security
- Secrets must be encrypted at rest
- Export functions must sanitize sensitive data
- Version compatibility must be maintained

### Performance
- Commitment generation remains efficient
- Storage overhead is minimal
- Proof generation is unaffected

### Compatibility
- Backwards compatibility through versioning
- Graceful degradation for missing fields
- Clear migration paths from existing formats

## Call to Action

We invite the privacy protocol community to:

1. **Review** the proposed standard and provide feedback
2. **Experiment** with the format in test environments
3. **Collaborate** on improvements and extensions
4. **Consider** adoption timelines for your protocol

## Example Implementation

```typescript
// Standard-compliant commitment as used by early adopters
const commitment = {
  standard: {
    version: "1.0.0",
    format: "privacy-commitment-standard"
  },
  commitment: "0x1234...",
  secret: "0x5678...",  // Encrypted
  nullifier: "0x9abc...",
  crypto: {
    curve: "bn254",
    hashFunction: "poseidon",
    proofSystem: "sp1"
  },
  network: {
    chainId: 1,
    protocol: "innocence",
    contractAddress: "0xdef0..."
  },
  balances: {
    "ETH": "1.0",
    "USDC": "1000.0"
  },
  privacy: {
    anonymitySetSize: 1250
  },
  status: "active",
  timestamp: 1701234567890
};
```

## Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Current Protocols | Proposed Standard |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Interoperability | ❌ None | ✅ Full |
| Multi-asset | Mixed | ✅ Native |
| Standardized | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Tooling | Fragmented | Unified |
| Anonymity Sets | Isolated | Potentially Shared |

## Next Steps

1. **Community Review Period**: 30 days for feedback
2. **Reference Implementation**: Expand beyond early adopters
3. **Tool Development**: Management interfaces and SDKs
4. **Formal Proposal**: Submit as EIP/Standard
5. **Ecosystem Adoption**: Support integration efforts

## Conclusion

A unified privacy commitment standard would significantly advance the DeFi privacy ecosystem. By learning from existing implementations and designing for interoperability, we can create a more private, efficient, and user-friendly future for decentralized finance.

The successful implementation by Innocence Protocol and HX Finance demonstrates that this standard is not just theoretical but practically viable today. We encourage the broader ecosystem to join us in making privacy commitments truly interoperable.
