## Detailed Instructions

### Making Your First Private Deposit

#### 1. Preparation
- Ensure you have tokens to deposit
- Have HYPE for gas fees
- Use a secure environment (not public WiFi)

#### 2. Generate Commitment
When you click "Deposit", the system will:
- Generate a unique commitment for your deposit
- Create a secret and nullifier pair
- Display these for you to save

<Callout type="error">
  **Security Alert**: Your commitment details are like private keys. Never share them and store them encrypted offline.
</Callout>

#### 3. Commitment Storage Best Practices
- **Write it down**: Physical backup on paper
- **Encrypt digitally**: Use password manager
- **Never screenshot**: Avoid digital image storage
- **Multiple backups**: Store in 2-3 secure locations

### Executing Private Swaps

#### Single-Hop Swaps
Direct swaps between token pairs with liquidity pools:
- Fastest execution
- Lowest fees
- Best for common pairs

#### Multi-Hop Swaps
Routed through multiple pools for better pricing:
- Automatic routing
- May have better rates
- Slightly higher gas costs

#### Swap Settings
- **Slippage Tolerance**: Set between 0.5% - 3%
- **Deadline**: Transaction validity period
- **Min Output**: Protection against price changes

### Managing Multiple Commitments

You can have multiple active commitments:

1. **Commitment Dashboard**
   - View all your commitments
   - Check balances
   - Track swap history

2. **Nonce System**
   - Each commitment can perform multiple swaps
   - Nonces prevent double-spending
   - Sequential nonce enforcement

### Advanced Features

#### Partial Withdrawals
You don't need to withdraw everything at once:
- Withdraw any amount up to your balance
- Remaining funds stay in privacy pool
- Multiple withdrawals from same commitment

#### Cross-Token Privacy
Your privacy extends across tokens:
- Deposit WHYPE, withdraw USDE
- No on-chain link between deposit and withdrawal
- Complete transaction graph privacy

## Best Practices

### Security

1. **Commitment Management**
   - Use unique secrets for each deposit
   - Never reuse nullifiers
   - Store backups securely

2. **Transaction Timing**
   - Avoid patterns in deposit/withdrawal times
   - Use random amounts when possible
   - Consider time delays between actions

3. **Network Security**

   - Avoid public networks
   - Clear browser cache after sessions

### Gas Optimization

- **Batch Operations**: Plan multiple swaps together
- **Optimal Times**: Trade during low network congestion
- **Token Approvals**: Set reasonable allowances

### Privacy Maximization

1. **Amount Obfuscation**
   - Use non-round numbers
   - Vary deposit amounts
   - Split large amounts

2. **Timing Strategies**
   - Random delays between transactions
   - Avoid predictable patterns
   - Use different times of day

3. **Address Management**

   - Avoid linking to KYC addresses
   - Use different addresses for different purposes
