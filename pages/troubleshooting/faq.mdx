# FAQ - We've Got Answers! 🤔

All your burning questions about hx.finance, answered by the community.

## General Questions 🌟

### What exactly is hx.finance?
We're the community-owned DEX on Hyperliquid! Think Uniswap, but faster, cheaper, and with a fair launch where YOU get 33% of the tokens. No VCs, no BS, just good vibes and great tech.

### Why should I use hx.finance over other DEXs?
- **Lightning fast** ⚡ - Quick trades on Hyperliquid
- **Dirt cheap fees** 💸 - Gas costs are basically nothing
- **You earn points** 🏆 - Every trade gets you closer to $HX tokens
- **Fair launch** 🤝 - 33% to community, not to VCs
- **Part of an ecosystem** 🌐 - Privacy tools and mobile apps coming!

### Is it safe?
Absolutely! We use battle-tested Uniswap V3 contracts, everything is non-custodial (you always control your funds), and the code is open source. Plus, no rug pulls here - we're too busy building! 🛠️

### Which wallets can I use?
Any EVM wallet works! MetaMask is our fave, but WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, and Trust Wallet all work great too.

## Trading Questions 💱

### What tokens can I trade?
Right now:
- **WHYPE** - Wrapped HYPE (the OG)
- **USDE** - Ethena's stablecoin 
- **UETH** - Wrapped ETH
- **UBTC** - Wrapped Bitcoin

More coming soon! Got requests? Drop them in Discord!

### What are the fees?
Super reasonable:
- **0.05%** for stable pairs (like USDE/USDC)
- **0.3%** for most pairs (the sweet spot)
- **1%** for exotic stuff

All fees go to liquidity providers - that could be you! 👀

### Why did my trade fail?
Usually one of these:
- **Not enough gas** → Keep 0.1 HYPE for fees
- **Slippage too low** → Bump it to 1-2%
- **Price moved** → Try again, prices update fast!
- **Need token approval** → One-time thing for new tokens

### What's slippage?
It's how much price movement you'll accept. Think of it as your "price flexibility":
- **0.5%** = "I want exactly this price"
- **1-2%** = "A little wiggle room is fine"
- **5%+** = "Just get me those tokens!"

## Liquidity Questions 💧

### What's concentrated liquidity?
Instead of spreading your money across all prices (old school), you pick a price range. It's like fishing where the fish actually are instead of the whole ocean! 🎣

### How much can I earn as an LP?
Depends on:
- **Volume** 📊 - More trades = more fees
- **Your range** 🎯 - Tighter = higher returns (but needs more attention)
- **Competition** 👥 - Your share of the pool

We've seen APYs from 20% to 200%+. Not financial advice, but... 👀

### What's impermanent loss?
It's when the tokens you deposited change price relative to each other. Only "real" when you withdraw. Good news: fee earnings often make up for it!

### Can I lose money?
Real talk: Yes, through impermanent loss or if you go out of range. But many LPs make bank from fees. Start small, learn the ropes!

## Points & Token Questions 🏆

### How do points work?
Simple:
- **Trading**: 0.01 points per dollar 
- **Liquidity**: 0.24 points per dollar per day
- **Tiers**: Multiply everything up to 1.5x!

### When moon... I mean, when token?
$HX launches Soon™. We'll announce 30 days before. Follow our Twitter for the alpha!

### Can I buy points?
Nope! That's the "fair" in fair launch. Points only come from using the platform. No shortcuts, everyone plays by the same rules.

### What happens to my points?
At TGE, your points convert to $HX tokens. Your share = your points ÷ total points × 33% of supply. Math is beautiful! 🧮
