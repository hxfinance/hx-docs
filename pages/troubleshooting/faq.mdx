### What are the fees?
HX Finance uses dynamic fees that automatically adjust:
- **Base fee**: Typically 0.05% for most pairs
- **Automatic adjustment**: Increases during high volatility
- **No manual selection**: Fees optimize automatically
- **Transparent**: Current fee shown before each trade

All fees are distributed to liquidity providers.

### Why did my trade fail?
Common reasons:
- **Insufficient gas** - Keep 0.1 HYPE for transaction fees
- **Low slippage tolerance** - Increase to 1-2%
- **Price movement** - Retry the transaction
- **Token approval needed** - One-time approval required for new tokens

### What is slippage?
Slippage tolerance is the maximum price difference you'll accept between order placement and execution:
- **0.5%** - Minimal price variance
- **1-2%** - Standard tolerance
- **5%+** - High tolerance for volatile conditions

## Liquidity Questions

### What is concentrated liquidity?
Concentrated liquidity allows providers to allocate capital within specific price ranges rather than across the entire price curve, resulting in higher capital efficiency.

### How much can I earn as an LP?
Returns depend on:
- **Trading volume** - Higher volume generates more fees
- **Price range** - Narrower ranges can yield higher returns but require more management
- **Pool competition** - Your proportional share of liquidity

Historical APYs have varied from 20% to over 200%.

### What is impermanent loss?
Impermanent loss occurs when the relative price of deposited tokens changes. This loss only becomes permanent upon withdrawal. Fee earnings often offset this risk.

### Can I lose money?
Yes, liquidity provision carries risks including impermanent loss and being out of range. However, fee earnings can compensate for these risks. Consider starting with smaller positions while learning.

## Points & Token Questions

### How do points work?
Simple:
- **Trading**: 0.01 points per dollar 
- **Liquidity**: 0.24 points per dollar per day
- **Tiers**: Multiply everything up to 1.5x!

### When will the token launch?
The hx.finance token generation event (TGE) date will be announced 30 days in advance through official channels.

### What is HXP?
HXP is our on-chain points token that runs parallel to standard points:
- **1:1 ratio** with standard points
- **Automatically minted** as you earn
- **Blockchain verified** for transparency
- **May become tradeable** in the future

Both HXP and standard points convert equally to hx.finance tokens at TGE.

### Can I buy points?
No. Points can only be earned through platform usage, ensuring fair distribution.

### What happens to my points?
At TGE, points convert to hx.finance tokens. Your allocation = (your points ÷ total points) × 33% of total supply.
