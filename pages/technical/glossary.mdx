# Glossary

Key terms and concepts used throughout HX Finance.

## Core Concepts

### AMM (Automated Market Maker)
A decentralized exchange protocol that uses smart contracts to create liquidity pools and enable trading without traditional order books.

### Concentrated Liquidity
The ability to provide liquidity within specific price ranges rather than across all possible prices, dramatically increasing capital efficiency.

### Dynamic Fees
Fees that automatically adjust based on market conditions, volatility, and trading volume - no manual tier selection needed.

### Liquidity Pool
A smart contract containing reserves of two tokens that traders can swap between. Liquidity providers earn fees from trades.

### Price Range
The upper and lower price bounds within which a liquidity position is active and earning fees.

### Tick
The smallest unit of price movement in concentrated liquidity. Each tick represents a 0.01% (1 basis point) price change.

## Positions & Trading

### In-Range Position
A liquidity position where the current market price falls within the position's selected price range, actively earning fees.

### Out-of-Range Position
A liquidity position where the current price has moved outside the selected range. The position stops earning fees but can be repositioned.

### Price Impact
The change in token price caused by a trade. Larger trades relative to pool liquidity cause higher price impact.

### Slippage
The difference between expected and executed price due to market movements between transaction submission and execution.

### TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)
An oracle mechanism that provides the average price over a specific time period, resistant to manipulation.

## Liquidity Provision

### LP (Liquidity Provider)
Users who deposit token pairs into pools to facilitate trading and earn fees.

### LP Token/NFT
A non-fungible token representing ownership of a specific liquidity position with defined parameters.

### Impermanent Loss
The difference in value between holding tokens in a liquidity pool versus holding them directly, caused by price movements.

### Capital Efficiency
The ratio of effective liquidity to total capital deployed. Concentrated liquidity can be up to 4000x more capital efficient.

### Range Order
Using a narrow liquidity range as a limit order - the position converts from one token to another as price crosses the range.

## HX Finance Specific

### HXP
On-chain points token that mirrors standard points 1:1, providing blockchain verification and potential future tradability.

### Points Multiplier
Tier-based bonuses that multiply all points earned, ranging from 1.0x (Bronze) to 2.0x (Diamond).

### WHYPE
Wrapped HYPE token (ERC-20 compatible version of native HYPE) used for trading in pools.

### Base Tokens
Core tokens used for routing: WHYPE, USDE, UETH, UBTC, and others that form trading pair foundations.

## Technical Terms

### Factory Contract
Smart contract responsible for deploying new trading pools with consistent parameters.

### Router Contract
Smart contract that finds optimal trading paths and executes swaps across one or multiple pools.

### Position Manager
Smart contract (NFT manager) that handles the creation, modification, and tracking of liquidity positions.

### Tick Spacing
The minimum distance between initialized ticks in a pool, affecting position granularity and gas costs.

### Sqrt Price
Square root of the price ratio used internally for calculations, enabling efficient math operations.

## Fee Terms

### Base Fee
The starting fee level for a pool before dynamic adjustments.

### Fee Tier (Legacy)
Fixed fee levels used in older AMM versions (0.05%, 0.3%, 1%). HX Finance uses dynamic fees instead.

### Protocol Fee
Optional fee that can be activated by governance, separate from LP fees.

### Fee APY
Annualized percentage yield from trading fees, calculated based on 24h or 7d fee generation.

## Safety Terms

### Allowance
Permission given to a smart contract to spend tokens on your behalf, required before swaps or liquidity provision.

### Deadline
Transaction expiration time to prevent execution during unfavorable conditions.

### Minimum Output
The minimum tokens you'll accept from a swap, protecting against excessive slippage.
