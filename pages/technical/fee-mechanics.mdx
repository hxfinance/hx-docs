# Fee Mechanics

Understanding how dynamic fees work on HX Finance.

## Dynamic Fee System

Unlike traditional AMMs with fixed fee tiers, HX Finance implements dynamic fees that automatically adjust to market conditions.

### How Dynamic Fees Work

1. **Base Fee Level**
   - Most pools start with a base fee around 0.05%
   - This represents the minimum fee during stable conditions

2. **Automatic Adjustments**
   - Fees increase during high volatility periods
   - Fees decrease during stable market conditions
   - No manual intervention required

3. **Optimization Logic**
   - Balances LP returns with trading volume
   - Higher fees protect LPs during risky periods
   - Lower fees attract volume during calm markets

## Benefits for Different Users

## Fee Distribution

### Where Fees Go
```
Trading Fee
    └── 100% to Liquidity Providers
         └── Distributed pro-rata based on:
              - Share of liquidity in range
              - Time price spent in range
```

### Fee Collection
- Fees accumulate in the position
- Can be collected anytime
- No automatic distribution
- Gas-efficient batch collection

## Comparing Fee Models

| Feature | Fixed Fees (Traditional) | Dynamic Fees (HX Finance) |
|---------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Stable market fees | Same as volatile | Lower (optimized) |
| Volatile market fees | Same as stable | Higher (protection) |
| LP returns | Suboptimal | Maximized |
| Trader costs | Fixed regardless | Market-appropriate |
| Management needed | Choose tier manually | Fully automatic |

## Real-World Examples

### Stable Market Scenario
```
USDE/USDC pair during calm period:
- Traditional AMM: 0.05% fixed
- HX Finance: 0.04% (dynamically lowered)
- Benefit: More volume, competitive rates
```

### Volatile Market Scenario
```
WHYPE/USDE during price discovery:
- Traditional AMM: 0.3% fixed
- HX Finance: 0.45% (dynamically increased)
- Benefit: LPs protected from impermanent loss
```

### Multi-Market Arbitrage
```
Cross-DEX arbitrage opportunity:
- Other DEX: 0.3% fixed fee
- HX Finance: 0.05% current fee
- Result: Arbitrageurs choose HX, increasing volume
```

## Fee Monitoring

### For Traders
1. Check current fee before swapping
2. Displayed in swap interface
3. Included in price impact calculation
4. Historical fee data available

### For LPs
1. Monitor fee trends in analytics
2. Higher fees = higher APY
3. Position in volatile pools for maximum fees
4. Track cumulative fee earnings

## Technical Implementation

### Fee Calculation
```javascript
// Simplified logic
currentFee = baseFee * volatilityMultiplier

where:
- baseFee = pool's minimum fee
- volatilityMultiplier = calculated from:
  - Recent price movements
  - Trading volume
  - Time-weighted volatility
```

### Fee Bounds
- Minimum: ~0.01% (ultra-stable pairs)
- Maximum: ~1% (extreme volatility)
- Most common: 0.04% - 0.1%
