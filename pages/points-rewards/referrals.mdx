# Referrals

Earn bonus points by inviting friends to HX.Finance and get rewarded when they trade.

## How Referrals Work

The referral system lets you earn additional points in two ways:
- **Earn from friends**: Get 17.5% of all points your referrals earn
- **Milestone bonuses**: Unlock rewards at 10, 50, and 100 referrals

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Get Your Referral Code
1. Go to the [Points page](https://app.hx.finance/points)
2. Click the "Referrals" tab
3. Create a custom code or use the auto-generated one
4. Share your code with friends

### Step 2: Your Friends Join
When friends use your code:
- They get a **1.2x points multiplier for 30 days** (20% bonus!)
- You earn **17.5% of all their points**
- Both of you benefit!

## Referral Rewards

### Ongoing Rewards
**You earn 17.5% of all points your referrals generate**

Example:
- Your friend trades $1,000 = 10 points for them
- You automatically get 1.75 bonus points
- Your friend provides $10,000 liquidity for a month = 72,000 points
- You get 12,600 bonus points!

### Milestone Bonuses
Unlock one-time bonuses as you grow your network:

- **10 Referrals** → 500 bonus points
- **50 Referrals** → 3,000 bonus points  
- **100 Referrals** → 10,000 bonus points

## For New Users

### Using a Referral Code
If someone referred you:
1. Enter their code when you first connect your wallet
2. Get an instant **1.2x multiplier on all points for 30 days**
