# How Points Work

Learn how the points system works and how points convert to hx.finance tokens at launch.

## Overview

HX Finance runs a dual points system:

- **Standard Points**: Traditional database-tracked points for UI display
- **HXP (On-chain Points)**: Experimental blockchain-recorded points
- **Both systems run in parallel** with identical earning rates
- **Future trading potential** for HXP tokens

## Two Ways to Earn Points

### 1. Trading Points
**Rate: 0.01 points per dollar traded**
**Minimum: $10 per trade to earn points**

```
Examples:
$100 swap = 1 point
$1,000 swap = 10 points  
$10,000 swap = 100 points
```

### 2. Liquidity Points
**Rate: 0.24 points per dollar per day**
**Minimum Hold Time: 24 hours for full points**

```
Examples:
$1,000 in pools = 240 points/day = 7,200 points/month
$10,000 in pools = 2,400 points/day = 72,000 points/month

⚠️ Important: Removing liquidity does NOT earn points!
```

## Tier System

Your tier multiplies all your points. Higher tiers provide better multipliers.

### Bronze: Newcomer
- **Range**: 0-999 points
- **Multiplier**: 1.0x

### Silver: Active Trader
- **Range**: 1,000-9,999 points
- **Multiplier**: 1.1x (+10%)

### Gold: Power User
- **Range**: 10,000-49,999 points
- **Multiplier**: 1.25x (+25%)

### Platinum: DeFi Whale
- **Range**: 50,000-99,999 points
- **Multiplier**: 1.5x (+50%)

### Diamond: Legend
- **Range**: 100,000+ points
- **Multiplier**: 2.0x (+100%)

## How Tiers Work

**Key Features:**
- Tier upgrades are instant
- You can never go down a tier
- New multipliers apply immediately

**Example Journey:**
```
Day 1: Trade $100 → 1 point (Bronze)
Day 5: Hit 1,000 points → Now Silver! 
Day 6: Trade $100 → 1.1 points (10% bonus!)
Week 3: Hit 10,000 points → Gold unlocked!
Next trade: Trade $100 → 1.25 points (25% bonus!)
```

## Example Strategies

### Quick Start
Add $5,000 liquidity on day 1:
- Day 1: 1,200 points → Instant Silver tier!
- Every day after: 1,320 points (with 10% bonus)
- Week 1 total: 9,240 points → Almost Gold!
- **Important**: Hold for at least 24 hours to avoid penalties!

### Steady Progress
Trade $200 daily:
- Month 1: ~60 points (Bronze)
- Day 17: Hit 1,000 points → Silver achieved!
- Month 2: ~66 points/day (Silver bonus active)
- Month 6: Hit 10,000 points → Gold achieved!
- Consistent progress!

### Combined Approach
$2,000 liquidity + $100 daily trades:
- Daily: 480 + 1 = 481 points (Bronze)
- Day 3: Hit 1,000 points → Silver!
- Daily after: 529 points/day (with 10% bonus)
- Day 20: Hit 10,000 points → Gold!
- Daily after: 601 points/day (with 25% bonus)!

## HXP: On-Chain Points System

### What is HXP?
HXP is our blockchain-based points token that mirrors your standard points balance:
- **1 Standard Point = 1 HXP**
- **Automatically minted** as you earn points
- **Fully transparent** on the blockchain
- **Non-transferable** (currently)

### Future HXP Features
- **Potential Trading**: HXP may become tradeable before TGE
- **Price Discovery**: Market-based valuation of points
- **Liquidity Options**: Early exit opportunities
- **Governance Rights**: Possible voting power

### Viewing Your HXP
- Check balance in your wallet (token contract: `[HXP_ADDRESS]`)
- View on Hyperliquid Explorer
- Matches your standard points 1:1

## Points to Token Conversion

At TGE (Token Generation Event):
- 33% of total hx.finance token supply goes to point holders
- Your share = (Your points ÷ Total points) × 33% supply
- **Both standard points and HXP convert identically**

**Example Math:**
```
Total points: 100,000,000
Your points: 50,000
Your share: 0.05%
33% supply: 330,000,000 hx.finance tokens
You get: 165,000 hx.finance tokens
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do points expire?**
A: No, points remain valid until TGE.

**Q: Can I buy points?**
A: No, points can only be earned through platform usage.

**Q: When is TGE?**
A: Follow official announcements for updates.

**Q: Can I start earning points at any time?**
A: Yes, you can begin earning points immediately.

**Q: What's the difference between standard points and HXP?**
A: They're the same value (1:1 ratio) but HXP is recorded on-chain for transparency. Both convert equally at TGE.

**Q: Will HXP become tradeable?**
A: Possibly. This would allow early price discovery and liquidity, but no final decision has been made.

**Q: Do I need to claim HXP separately?**
A: No, HXP is automatically minted as you earn standard points. No additional actions required.

**Q: If HXP becomes tradeable, can I sell before TGE?**
A: If trading is enabled, yes. This would provide early liquidity options for point holders.

**Q: Do I get points for removing liquidity?**
A: No, removing liquidity does not earn points. In fact, removing liquidity within 24 hours of adding it will result in penalties on the points you earned.

**Q: What happens if I remove liquidity quickly?**
A: You'll face SEVERE penalties based on how long you held the position:
- Less than 1 hour: Lose 99% of earned points (keep only 1%)
- 1-6 hours: Lose 95% of earned points (keep only 5%)
- 6-12 hours: Lose 90% of earned points (keep only 10%)  
- 12-24 hours: Lose 80% of earned points (keep only 20%)
- 24+ hours: No penalty

⚠️ **This means removing within 24 hours essentially forfeits your points!**

**Q: Can I add and remove liquidity multiple times?**
A: Yes, but you're limited to 3 add/remove cycles per pool every 24 hours to prevent gaming.

## Fair Usage & Anti-Abuse

### Our Commitment
Points are designed to reward genuine platform usage. We actively monitor for and prevent manipulation to ensure fair distribution to real users who contribute to the ecosystem.

### Liquidity Provision Rules
- **No points for removing liquidity** - Only adding liquidity earns points
- **Time-based penalties** - Removing liquidity within 24 hours incurs SEVERE penalties:
  - < 1 hour: 99% penalty (you keep only 1% of points)
  - 1-6 hours: 95% penalty (you keep only 5% of points)
  - 6-12 hours: 90% penalty (you keep only 10% of points)
  - 12-24 hours: 80% penalty (you keep only 20% of points)
- **Rate limiting** - Maximum 3 add/remove cycles per pool per 24 hours
- **Minimum hold period** - 24 hours to earn full points without penalties

### Prohibited Activities
- **Sybil attacks** - Multiple accounts controlled by one entity
- **Wash trading** - Artificial volume through self-trading
- **Liquidity cycling** - Rapidly adding/removing liquidity to farm points
- **Gaming the system** - Exploiting loopholes or unintended mechanics
- **Bot manipulation** - Automated activity designed solely to farm points

### Enforcement
Accounts engaging in suspicious activity may face:
- Points reduction or removal
- Account restrictions
- Exclusion from token distribution

### Formula Updates
The points calculation formula:
- Updates periodically to maintain fairness
- Rewards consistent, organic activity
- Remains undisclosed to prevent exploitation
- Adapts to changing platform dynamics

Our priority is rewarding authentic participation. Users who engage naturally with the platform will always benefit most.
