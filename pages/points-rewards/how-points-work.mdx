# How Points Work

Learn how the points system works and how points convert to hx.finance tokens at launch.

## Overview

Points determine your share of hx.finance tokens at launch.

- **Earn by trading**
- **Earn by providing liquidity**
- **Multiply with tiers**
- **Convert to hx.finance tokens at TGE**

## Two Ways to Earn Points

### 1. Trading Points
**Rate: 0.01 points per dollar traded**
**Minimum: $10 per trade to earn points**

```
Examples:
$100 swap = 1 point
$1,000 swap = 10 points  
$10,000 swap = 100 points
```

### 2. Liquidity Points
**Rate: 0.24 points per dollar per day**

```
Examples:
$1,000 in pools = 240 points/day = 7,200 points/month
$10,000 in pools = 2,400 points/day = 72,000 points/month
```

## Tier System

Your tier multiplies all your points. Higher tiers provide better multipliers.

### Bronze: Newcomer
- **Range**: 0-999 points
- **Multiplier**: 1.0x

### Silver: Active Trader
- **Range**: 1,000-9,999 points
- **Multiplier**: 1.1x (+10%)

### Gold: Power User
- **Range**: 10,000-49,999 points
- **Multiplier**: 1.25x (+25%)

### Platinum: DeFi Whale
- **Range**: 50,000-99,999 points
- **Multiplier**: 1.5x (+50%)

### Diamond: Legend
- **Range**: 100,000+ points
- **Multiplier**: 2.0x (+100%)

## How Tiers Work

**Key Features:**
- Tier upgrades are instant
- You can never go down a tier
- New multipliers apply immediately

**Example Journey:**
```
Day 1: Trade $100 → 1 point (Bronze)
Day 5: Hit 1,000 points → Now Silver! 
Day 6: Trade $100 → 1.1 points (10% bonus!)
Week 3: Hit 10,000 points → Gold unlocked!
Next trade: Trade $100 → 1.25 points (25% bonus!)
```

## Example Strategies

### Quick Start
Add $5,000 liquidity on day 1:
- Day 1: 1,200 points → Instant Silver tier!
- Every day after: 1,320 points (with 10% bonus)
- Week 1 total: 9,240 points → Almost Gold!

### Steady Progress
Trade $200 daily:
- Month 1: ~60 points (Bronze)
- Day 17: Hit 1,000 points → Silver achieved!
- Month 2: ~66 points/day (Silver bonus active)
- Month 6: Hit 10,000 points → Gold achieved!
- Consistent progress!

### Combined Approach
$2,000 liquidity + $100 daily trades:
- Daily: 480 + 1 = 481 points (Bronze)
- Day 3: Hit 1,000 points → Silver!
- Daily after: 529 points/day (with 10% bonus)
- Day 20: Hit 10,000 points → Gold!
- Daily after: 601 points/day (with 25% bonus)!

## Points to Token Conversion

At TGE (Token Generation Event):
- 33% of total hx.finance token supply goes to point holders
- Your share = (Your points ÷ Total points) × 33% supply

**Example Math:**
```
Total points: 100,000,000
Your points: 50,000
Your share: 0.05%
33% supply: 330,000,000 hx.finance tokens
You get: 165,000 hx.finance tokens
```
