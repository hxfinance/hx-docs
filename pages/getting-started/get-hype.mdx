# Get HYPE & WHYPE

To use hx.finance, you'll need HYPE for gas fees and WHYPE (Wrapped HYPE) for trading. This guide explains how to get both.

## Understanding HYPE vs WHYPE

- **HYPE**: The native token of Hyperliquid, used for gas fees
- **WHYPE**: Wrapped HYPE, an ERC-20 version used for trading on hx.finance
- **1 HYPE = 1 WHYPE** (always)

## Getting HYPE

### Option 1: Bridge from Ethereum (Recommended)

1. Visit the [Hyperliquid Bridge](https://bridge.hyperliquid.xyz)
2. Connect your wallet on Ethereum
3. Enter the amount of ETH to bridge
4. Approve and confirm the transaction
5. Wait ~10 minutes for the bridge to complete
6. You'll receive HYPE on Hyperliquid

### Option 2: Buy on a CEX

Several exchanges support HYPE:
- Binance
- OKX
- Bybit
- Gate.io

After purchasing, withdraw directly to your Hyperliquid address.

### Option 3: OTC or P2P

- Ask in the Hyperliquid Discord
- Use trusted OTC desks
- Always verify addresses before sending

## Converting HYPE to WHYPE

Once you have HYPE, you need to wrap it to trade on hx.finance:

### Method 1: Using hx.finance Interface

1. Go to [hx.finance](https://hx.finance)
2. Click "Wrap" in the top menu
3. Enter the amount of HYPE to wrap

## How Much Do You Need?

### For Trading
- **Minimum**: 0.1 HYPE for gas + whatever you want to trade
- **Recommended**: 1+ HYPE for comfortable trading

### For Providing Liquidity

4. Done! Your WHYPE appears instantly

### Unwrap WHYPE → HYPE

## Pro Tips

- **Keep some HYPE unwrapped** for gas fees
- **Wrapping is instant** and costs minimal gas

### "Cannot Estimate Gas"
- Check you have enough HYPE
- Try reducing the amount slightly
- Refresh and try again

### Bridge Taking Too Long
- Ethereum → Hyperliquid usually takes 10-15 minutes
