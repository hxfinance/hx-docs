# Get HYPE & WHYPE

To use hx.finance, you'll need HYPE for gas fees and WHYPE (Wrapped HYPE) for trading. This guide explains how to get both.

## Understanding HYPE vs WHYPE

- **HYPE**: The native token of Hyperliquid, used for gas fees
- **WHYPE**: Wrapped HYPE, an ERC-20 version used for trading on hx.finance
- **1 HYPE = 1 WHYPE** (always)

## Getting HYPE

### Option 1: Buy on Hyperliquid (Recommended)

The easiest way is to buy HYPE directly on Hyperliquid:

1. Visit [app.hyperliquid.xyz](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Go to the Spot trading section
4. Buy HYPE with USDC or other tokens
5. Withdraw HYPE to your EVM wallet for use on hx.finance

### Option 2: Use Other DEXs

HYPE is available on several decentralized exchanges:
- hx.finance (that's us!)
- Other Hyperliquid-based DEXs
- Check liquidity and rates before trading

### Option 3: Buy on Centralized Exchanges

If you prefer CEXs, HYPE is listed on:
- Binance
- OKX
- Bybit
- Gate.io

After purchasing, withdraw directly to your Hyperliquid EVM address.


## Converting HYPE to WHYPE

Once you have HYPE, you need to wrap it to trade on hx.finance:

### Method 1: Using hx.finance Interface

1. Go to [app.hx.finance](https://app.hx.finance)
2. Click "Wrap" in the top menu
3. Enter the amount of HYPE to wrap
4. Click "Wrap HYPE"
5. Confirm the transaction

### Method 2: Direct Contract Interaction

For advanced users, you can interact directly with the WHYPE contract:
- **WHYPE Address**: `0x5555555555555555555555555555555555555555`

## How Much Do You Need?

### For Trading
- **Minimum**: 0.1 HYPE for gas + whatever you want to trade
- **Recommended**: 1+ HYPE for comfortable trading

### For Providing Liquidity
- **Minimum**: Enough for both tokens in your pair
- **Recommended**: $100+ worth for meaningful positions

## Quick Wrap/Unwrap

### Wrap HYPE → WHYPE
1. Click "Wrap" button
2. Enter amount
3. Confirm transaction
4. Done! Your WHYPE appears instantly

### Unwrap WHYPE → HYPE
1. Click "Unwrap" button
2. Enter amount
3. Confirm transaction
4. Done! Your HYPE is restored

## Important Notes

- Keep some HYPE unwrapped for gas fees
- Wrapping is instant and costs minimal gas
- You can wrap/unwrap anytime with no fees (except gas)
- WHYPE is required for all trading pairs

## Common Issues

### "Insufficient Gas"
- You need HYPE (not WHYPE) for gas
- Keep at least 0.01 HYPE unwrapped

### "Cannot Estimate Gas"
- Check you have enough HYPE
- Try reducing the amount slightly
- Refresh and try again
