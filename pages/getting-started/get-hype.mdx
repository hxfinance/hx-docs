# Get HYPE & WHYPE

To use hx.finance, you'll need HYPE for gas fees and WHYPE (Wrapped HYPE) for trading. This guide explains how to get both.

## Understanding HYPE vs WHYPE

- **HYPE**: The native token of Hyperliquid, used for gas fees
- **WHYPE**: Wrapped HYPE, an ERC-20 version used for trading on hx.finance
- **1 HYPE = 1 WHYPE** (always)

## Getting HYPE

### Option 1: Buy on Hyperliquid (Recommended)

The easiest way is to buy HYPE directly on Hyperliquid:

1. Visit [app.hyperliquid.xyz](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Go to the Spot trading section
4. Buy HYPE with USDC or other tokens
5. Withdraw HYPE to your EVM wallet for use on hx.finance

### Option 2: Use Other DEXs

HYPE is available on several decentralized exchanges:
- hx.finance (that's us!)
- Other Hyperliquid-based DEXs
- Check liquidity and rates before trading

### Option 3: Buy on Centralized Exchanges

If you prefer CEXs, HYPE is listed on:
- Binance
- OKX
- Bybit
- Gate.io

After purchasing, withdraw directly to your Hyperliquid EVM address.


## HYPE to WHYPE Conversion

When you trade on hx.finance, HYPE is automatically wrapped to WHYPE as needed. No manual wrapping is required - the interface handles this seamlessly during swaps.

**WHYPE Contract Address**: `0x5555555555555555555555555555555555555555`

## How Much Do You Need?

### For Trading
- **Minimum**: 0.1 HYPE for gas + whatever you want to trade
- **Recommended**: 1+ HYPE for comfortable trading

### For Providing Liquidity
- **Minimum**: Enough for both tokens in your pair
- **Recommended**: $100+ worth for meaningful positions

## Important Notes

- Keep HYPE in your wallet for gas fees
- HYPE wrapping to WHYPE happens automatically when trading
- No manual wrapping/unwrapping needed

## Common Issues

### "Insufficient Gas"

- Try reducing the amount slightly
