# Your First Swap 🎉

Ready to join the hx.finance family? Let's make your first trade together!

## Quick Check - You Ready? ✅

Before we dive in, make sure you've got:
- **Wallet connected** → [Need help?](/getting-started/connect-wallet)
- **Some HYPE for gas** → [Get some here](/getting-started/get-hype)
- **Tokens to trade** → WHYPE, USDE, or any supported token

Got everything? Let's go! 🚀

## The Simple Swap Guide

### Step 1: Head to the Swap Page 🔄

Jump over to [app.hx.finance](https://app.hx.finance) - this is where the magic happens!

### Step 2: Pick Your Tokens 🪙

Time to choose what you're trading!

**The "From" Token** (what you're selling)
- Click the top dropdown
- Pick from your wallet or search
- Pro tip: WHYPE/USDE is perfect for first-timers!

**The "To" Token** (what you're buying)
- Click the bottom dropdown  
- Choose your destination token
- The app only shows available pairs (no dead ends!)

### Step 3: How Much? 💰

Here's the cool part - you can enter EITHER:
- The amount you want to **sell** (top box), OR
- The amount you want to **buy** (bottom box)

The other one fills in automatically. It's like magic, but it's just math! ✨

### Step 4: The Important Stuff 👀

Before you hit that button, take a quick peek at:

**Exchange Rate** 💱
Shows you exactly what you're getting (e.g., 1 WHYPE = 50.25 USDE)

**Price Impact** 📊
- Green (< 0.1%) = You're golden! 
- Yellow (0.1-1%) = Still good!
- Orange (1-3%) = Maybe split this trade up?
- Red (> 3%) = Whoa there, big spender!

**Network Fee** ⛽
Usually less than $0.01. Yes, really!

### Step 5: Optional Settings ⚙️

Feeling adventurous? Click the gear icon:
- **Slippage**: How much price movement you'll accept (default 0.5% is usually fine)
- **Deadline**: How long before the trade expires (30 mins default)

### Step 6: Swap It! 🎯

This is it! The big moment!
- Hit that beautiful **"Swap"** button
- Review everything one more time
- Click **"Confirm Swap"**

### Step 7: Wallet Time 📱

Your wallet will pop up asking for approval:
- Double-check the details (always good practice!)
- Check the gas fee (should be tiny)
- Hit **"Confirm"**

### Step 8: Victory! 🎊

Boom! You did it! 
- Transaction confirms quickly
- Your new tokens appear in your wallet
- You just earned your first points!

## Let's Try an Example Together 🤝

Say you want to swap 10 WHYPE for USDE:

```
Starting with: 10 WHYPE
Current rate: 1 WHYPE = 50 USDE
You'll get: ~500 USDE
Price impact: 0.05% ✅
Network fee: ~$0.005
Points earned: 5 🎉
```

Easy peasy, right?

## Pro Tips from the Community 💡

### Start Small, Think Big
Your first swap doesn't need to be huge. Even $10 helps you learn the ropes!

### Watch That Impact
Keep price impact under 1% for the best rates. Big trades? Split 'em up!

### Points = Future $HX
Every dollar swapped = 0.01 points. It adds up fast!

### Gas is Basically Free
Seriously, we're talking pennies here. Hyperliquid is amazing like that.

## Common Hiccups (We've All Been There) 🤷

### "Insufficient Balance"
- Check you have enough tokens (including gas!)
- Remember: HYPE ≠ WHYPE

### "Price Impact Too High" 
- Your trade is too big for the pool
- Solution: Trade a smaller amount

### "Transaction Failed"
- Usually means slippage is too low
- Bump it up to 1% and try again
