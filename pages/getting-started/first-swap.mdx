# Your First Swap

## Prerequisites

Before trading, ensure you have:
- Wallet connected - [Connection guide](/getting-started/connect-wallet)
- HYPE for gas fees - [Get HYPE](/getting-started/get-hype)
- Tokens to trade (WHYPE, USDE, etc.)

## How to Swap

### Step 1: Navigate to the App

Visit [app.hx.finance](https://app.hx.finance)

### Step 2: Select Tokens

**From Token** (selling):

### Step 3: Enter Amount

You can specify either:

- Amount to buy (bottom field)

The corresponding amount is calculated automatically.

### Step 4: Review Trade Details

Check these important metrics:

**Exchange Rate**
Current price ratio between tokens (e.g., 1 WHYPE = 50.25 USDE)

**Price Impact**
- < 0.1% - Minimal impact (green)
- 0.1-1% - Acceptable (yellow)
- 1-3% - Consider smaller trades (orange)
- > 3% - High impact, split your trade (red)

**Network Fee**
Typically less than $0.01 on Hyperliquid

### Step 5: Settings (Optional)

Click the gear icon to adjust:
- **Slippage Tolerance**: Max price change allowed (default: 0.5%)

### Step 6: Execute Swap

1. Click the **"Swap"** button
2. Review transaction details in the confirmation window
3. Click **"Confirm Swap"**

### Step 7: Wallet Confirmation

Your wallet will prompt you to:
- Review transaction details
- Check gas fee estimate
- Click **"Confirm"** to execute

### Step 8: Transaction Complete

After confirmation:
- Transaction processes on-chain
- New tokens appear in your wallet
- Points are automatically credited

## Example Trade

Swapping 10 WHYPE for USDE:

```
Input: 10 WHYPE
Rate: 1 WHYPE = 50 USDE
Output: ~500 USDE
Price impact: 0.05%
Network fee: ~$0.005
Points earned: 5
```

## Trading Tips

**Start Small**
Practice with smaller amounts to understand the interface.

**Monitor Price Impact**
Keep impact under 1% for optimal rates. Split large trades if needed.

**Points Accumulation**
Every dollar traded earns 0.01 points towards your token allocation.

**Low Gas Costs**
Hyperliquid's efficient infrastructure keeps transaction costs minimal.

## Common Issues

### "Insufficient Balance"
- Verify token balance including gas
- Note: HYPE and WHYPE are different tokens

### "Price Impact Too High" 
- Trade size exceeds available liquidity
- Solution: Reduce trade amount

### "Transaction Failed"
- Often due to insufficient slippage tolerance
- Increase to 1% and retry
