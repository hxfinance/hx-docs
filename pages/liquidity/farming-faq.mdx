# Farming FAQ

Common questions about yield farming on HX Finance.

## General Questions

### What is the difference between LP fees and farming rewards?
- **LP Fees**: Earned from every swap in your pool (dynamic fees)
- **Farming Rewards**: Additional incentives on top of fees
- Both accumulate simultaneously when farming

### Do I need to stake my LP position to earn fees?
No. LP positions earn trading fees automatically. Staking in farms adds extra rewards on top of base fees.

### Can I farm with any liquidity position?
Each farm has specific requirements:
- Correct token pair
- Minimum liquidity amount
- Sometimes specific price ranges
Check farm details before adding liquidity.

### Are there lock-up periods?
No. Current farms have no lock-up periods. You can unstake and withdraw liquidity anytime.

## Rewards & Returns

### How are farming rewards calculated?
```
Your Share = Your Staked Liquidity / Total Staked Liquidity
Daily Rewards = Total Daily Rewards × Your Share × Multipliers
```

### What affects my farming APR?
1. **Pool TVL**: Lower TVL = higher share of rewards
2. **Price Range**: Concentrated positions earn more
3. **Multipliers**: Points tier and pool multipliers
4. **Token Prices**: Reward token value changes

### When are rewards distributed?
- Accumulate in real-time (every block)
- Visible in dashboard immediately
- Must claim manually to receive
- No automatic distribution

### Can I see pending rewards before claiming?
Yes. The farming dashboard shows:
- Pending rewards in real-time
- Historical earnings
- Estimated daily/weekly rates
- Current APR

## Technical Questions

### What happens if my position goes out of range?
- Continue earning farming rewards
- Stop earning trading fees
- Consider rebalancing for optimal returns
- No penalty for being out of range

### Can I stake multiple positions in one farm?
Yes. You can stake multiple LP NFTs in the same farm. Rewards are calculated based on total staked liquidity.

### Do I pay fees on farming rewards?
- No protocol fees on rewards
- Standard network gas fees for claiming
- Consider batching claims to save gas

### How do multipliers work?
Multipliers stack multiplicatively:
```
Base Rewards × Pool Multiplier × Tier Multiplier = Total
Example: 100 × 3x (pool) × 1.5x (tier) = 450 points
```

## Strategy Questions

### Should I farm stable or volatile pairs?
**Stable Pairs**:
- Lower impermanent loss
- Predictable returns
- Good for beginners

**Volatile Pairs**:
- Higher fees + rewards
- Higher risk
- Better for active managers

### What's the best price range for farming?
Depends on strategy:
- **Full range**: Safe, lower returns
- **±20-30%**: Balanced approach
- **±5-10%**: High returns, needs monitoring
- Match to your management style

### Should I compound farming rewards?
Compounding increases returns significantly:
- Claim rewards weekly/monthly
- Re-stake in same pool
- Exponential growth over time
- Consider gas costs

### How often should I rebalance?
- **Stable pairs**: Monthly or less
- **Volatile pairs**: Weekly or when 50% out of range
- **Active strategy**: Daily monitoring
- **Gas costs**: Factor into frequency

## Risk Questions

### What are the main risks?
1. **Impermanent Loss**: Token price divergence
2. **Out of Range**: Missing fee income
3. **Reward Token Price**: Value fluctuations
4. **Smart Contract**: Technical risks

### Can I lose my staked tokens?
Your LP tokens remain safe:
- Fully withdrawable anytime
- No admin control over funds
- Audited contracts
- Non-custodial system

### What if farming program ends?
- Existing positions remain safe
- Can unstake anytime
- Still earn trading fees
- Move to new farms when available

### How do I track performance?
Use available tools:
- Dashboard for real-time data
- Export transaction history
- Track IL with calculators
