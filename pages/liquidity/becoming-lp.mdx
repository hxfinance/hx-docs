- Deposit token pairs into pools
- Enable others to trade
- Earn fees from every swap

- Can withdraw anytime

## Why Provide Liquidity?

## Understanding Concentrated Liquidity

Unlike traditional AMMs, hx.finance uses **concentrated liquidity**:

### Traditional AMM
- Liquidity spread across all prices
- Capital inefficient
- Lower fee earnings

### Concentrated Liquidity
- Focus liquidity in specific price ranges
- Up to 4000x more efficient
- Higher fee earnings
- Requires more management

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Choose Your Pool

Navigate to the [Pools page](https://hx.finance/pools)

**Popular Pools:**
- WHYPE/USDE (High volume)
- WHYPE/USD₮0 (High volume)
- WHYPE/USDXL (High volume)

- BUDDY/USDE (Community favorite)

**Consider:**
- 24h Volume (Higher = More fees)
- TVL (Total Value Locked)
- Current APY
- Your token holdings

### Step 2: Click "Add Liquidity"

Find your chosen pool and click "Add Liquidity"

### Step 3: Select Your Price Range

This is the most important decision!

**Full Range (Easy)**
- Covers all possible prices
- No management needed
- Lower capital efficiency
- Good for beginners

**Narrow Range (Advanced)**
- Higher fee earnings
- Requires monitoring
- Risk of going out of range
- Best for active managers

### Step 4: Choose Fee Tier

- **0.05%**: Stable pairs (USDE/USDC)
- **0.3%**: Most pairs (WHYPE/USDE)
- **1%**: Exotic/volatile pairs

### Step 5: Enter Amounts

**Balanced Deposit**
- Enter amount for one token
- Other amount auto-calculates
- Must maintain pool ratio

**Custom Amounts**
- Possible within your range
- May create unbalanced position

### Step 6: Review & Add

Check before confirming:
- Price range set correctly
- Token amounts accurate
- Estimated fees/APY
- Points earning rate

### Step 7: Approve & Confirm

- Approve token spending (first time only)

## Real Example: Adding to WHYPE/USDE

Let's add $1,000 of liquidity:

**Pool Selection**
- Pool: WHYPE/USDE 0.3%
- Current Price: 1 WHYPE = 50 USDE
- 24h Volume: $500,000
- TVL: $2,000,000

**Range Selection**
- Current Price: 50 USDE
- Lower Bound: 40 USDE (-20%)
- Upper Bound: 60 USDE (+20%)
- Conservative but effective

**Deposit Amounts**
- 10 WHYPE ($500)
- 500 USDE ($500)
- Total: $1,000

**Expected Returns**
- Daily Fees: ~$6.25 (0.625%)
- Daily Points: 240 (before multipliers)
- Monthly: ~$187.50 + 7,200 points

## Managing Your Position

### Monitoring
- Check position daily
- Watch price movements
- Track fee earnings
- Monitor point accumulation

### When to Adjust
- Price nearing range boundaries
- Significant volume changes
- Better opportunities arise
- Rebalancing needed

### Collecting Fees
- Fees accumulate in position
- Collect anytime
- No automatic distribution
- Gas efficient to batch

## Advanced Strategies

### 1. Range Orders
Use tight ranges as limit orders:
- Set range above/below current price
- Acts like a limit order
- Earns fees while waiting

### 2. Volatility Harvesting
For volatile pairs:
- Wide ranges during calm periods
- Tight ranges during trends
- Adjust based on momentum

### 3. Multiple Positions
Diversify across ranges:
- Core position (wide range)
- Satellite positions (tight ranges)
- Different fee tiers

### 4. Rebalancing Strategy
- Take profits from out-of-range positions
- Redeploy at current prices
- Compound earnings

## Understanding Impermanent Loss

### What It Is
- Temporary loss vs holding
- Occurs when prices change
- Realized only on withdrawal

### How to Minimize
- Choose correlated pairs
- Use appropriate ranges
- Earn enough fees to offset
- Consider stable pairs

### Example Calculation
```
Initial: 10 WHYPE + 500 USDE ($1,000)
Price doubles: WHYPE = 100 USDE
Position value: ~$1,414
If held: $1,500
IL: ~5.7% ($86)

Fee earnings of $200 would result in net profit.
```
