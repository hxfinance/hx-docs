## Maximizing Farm Yields

### Strategy 1: Concentrated Positions
```
Narrow Range Benefits:
- Higher fee earnings
- Larger share of rewards
- Risk: Going out of range

Example: ±10% range on WHYPE/USDE
- 10x capital efficiency
- 10x more rewards per dollar
```

### Strategy 2: Stable Pair Farming
```
Wide Range Benefits:
- Lower maintenance
- Consistent rewards
- Minimal impermanent loss

Example: Full range on USDE/USDC
- Set and forget
- Steady returns
```

### Strategy 3: Active Management
```
Rebalancing Strategy:
1. Monitor price movements
2. Adjust ranges weekly
3. Compound rewards
4. Maximize in-range time

Best for: Experienced LPs
Returns: Highest potential
```

## Reward Calculations

### Base Formula
```
Your Rewards = (Your Liquidity / Total Liquidity) × Daily Rewards × Time
```

### With Multipliers
```
Final Rewards = Base Rewards × Points Multiplier × Tier Multiplier
```

### Example Calculation
```
Investment: $10,000 in WHYPE/USDE
Pool TVL: $1,000,000
Your Share: 1%
Daily Rewards: 10,000 points
Base Earning: 100 points/day

With 3x multiplier: 300 points/day
With Diamond tier (2x): 600 points/day
Monthly total: 18,000 points
```

## Risk Management

### Understanding Risks
1. **Impermanent Loss**: Price divergence reduces value
2. **Out of Range**: Stop earning when price moves
3. **Opportunity Cost**: Locked capital vs other uses
4. **Smart Contract Risk**: Audited but never zero

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with stable pairs
- Use wider ranges initially
- Diversify across multiple farms
- Monitor positions regularly
- Take profits periodically

## Advanced Farming

### NFT Position Management
- Each position is an NFT
- Can stake multiple positions
- Transfer between wallets
- Sell positions (with rewards)

### Compounding Strategies
1. **Manual Compound**
   - Claim rewards weekly
   - Re-stake into same pool
   - Exponential growth

2. **Auto-Compound** (Coming Soon)
   - Automatic re-investment
   - Gas-efficient
   - Set and forget
